## Description


Artless gauge is gauge with minimal design. Gauge has two layouts - linear and radial. Both layouts support regular mode and differential mode. With differential mode, the indicating colored track is drawn from center to side.

## Configuration
### Size
For linear layout the supported height is up to 2 units. 
For radial mode the minimal size is 2x2 units. Supported size configuration for radial layout is square (3x3, 4x4, ...). Widget forces different size combinations to be square, based on shortest side.

### Input 
Configured input property (default is <code>msg.payload</code>) should carry single numeric value.

### Label
Label can be any string. Label field does not support any html for color or size adjustments.

### Icon
Supported icons are same as for dashboard: [Font Awesome 4.7](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/), [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) and [Weather icons lite](https://github.com/Paul-Reed/weather-icons-lite). 
Icon field does not support any html for icon appearance adjustments.

### Layout
Choose layout type. Layout can be linear or radial.

### Mode
Option to turn on differential mode. With this option selected, the colored track has center point from which the value is shown. Value of center point can be adjusted. If center value is not defined, the center point is exactly between configured min and max.

### Range
Configure minimum and maximum expected values and adjust line color. Add segments and configure colors for them if needed. Note that MIN and MAX options can not be removed. A small dot with segment color can be drawn at the point of segment. To show dot for segment, configure size for dot bigger that zero.

### Line width
You can adjust thickness of the colored bar. The range of possible values depends on layout and configured size.

### Track color
Color of track background line can be configured. By default, the site colors used.

### Tickmarks
Min and max values can be shown near the track.
For differential mode, also the center value is shown.
With radial layout the tickmarks can be shown only if layout size is 3x3 units or more.

### Format
#### Unit
Unit is displayed near the value field. Unit can be any string.
#### Decimals 
Value is always rounded according to the configured decimals. Default is zero so value presented as integer.  

## Change the configuration at runtime

Many options of widget configuration can be overrided at runtime using the <code>msg.control</code> property.
You can send options one by one, or all together.
Note, that min and max must be part of sectors property.
Change of min or max will not affect sectors if they were configured. But any sector update clears all previously configured sectors except the min and max.
There is no validation on top of incoming sectors configuration.

#### Configurable options and value types

``` javascript
sectors - Array of ObjectÂ´s
unit - String
label - String
icon - String
center - Number
decimals - Number
```
#### Example
``` javascript
var newSectors = [{t:"min",val:5,col:"#00ff00",dot:3},{t:"sec",val:8,col:"#ff0000",dot:3},{t:"max",val:30,col:"#0000ff",dot:3}]
msg.control = {unit:"degrees",label:"Temperature",icon:"fa-thermometer",center:4, decimals:1, sectors:newSectors}
```
